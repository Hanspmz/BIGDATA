    "\n",
    "- Write-ahead log shipping: the log is an append-only sequence of bytes containing all writes to the database. We can use the exact same log to build a replica on another node: besides writing the log to disk, the leader also sends it across the network to its followers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logical log replication: use different log formats for replication and for the storage engine, which allows the replication log to be decoupled from the storage engine internals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trigger-based replication: A trigger lets you register custom application code that is automatically executed when a data change occurs in a database system. "
